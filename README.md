# Fredriks amazing dotfiles

This is my personal config repository to keep track of what I change/add/remove in my configuration files.
Feel free to use.

The theme `palenight` is inspired by Whizkydee's [vscode-material-palenight-theme](https://github.com/whizkydee/vscode-material-palenight-theme), used as overrides on palenight.vim

Currently these dotfiles only includes my nvim config.

## Installation

These instructions presume you have `nvim` already installed

This configuration uses [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as plugin manager. Install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#neovim) first.

1. To use, put these files in `~/.config/nvim`
2. Make sure you have `bat` and `ripgrep` installed.
* `brew install bat && brew install ripgrep`
3. Open `nvim` and issue `:PlugInstall`
4. Profit
